                        The secret of being happy is accepting where you are in life
                        and making the most out of everyday. <br/>
                        The only thing that will make you happy is being happy with who you are. <br/>

                        Be happy with what you have. Be excited about what you want. <br/>
                        When you are happy, nothing else in the world matters, that is the 
                        truth among all truth. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

                        <b>Anxious</b><br/>
                        Trust yourself. You’ve survived a lot, and you’ll survive whatever is coming.<br/>
                        You don’t have to control your thoughts. You just have to stop letting them control you.

                        Anxiety happens when you think you have to figure out everything all at once.
                        Breathe. You’re strong. You got this. Take it day by day.<br/>
                        Sometimes you don’t realize the weight of something you’ve been carrying until you feel the weight of its release.

                        <b>Nervous</b><br/>
                        Relax; the world's not watching that closely. It's too busy contemplating itself in the mirror.<br/>
                        It is okay to be nervous. Instead of fighting that anxiety, dance with it.
                        Welcome it. Relish it. It is a sign you are on to something.

                        <b>Impatient</b><br/>
                        Patience is the art of concealing your impatience.<br/>
                        Impatience can cause wise people to do foolish things. <br/>
                        The goal to be reached is the mind’s insight into what knowing is. Impatience asks for the impossible, wants to reach 
                        the goal without the means of getting there.
